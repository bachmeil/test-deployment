# Math Support

There is math support in the form of MathJax.

For inline equations, surround the math by single dollar signs, like this: `$y_{t} = x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}$`, rendered as $y_{t} = x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}$.

For displayed equations, use double dollar signs: `$$y_{t} = x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}$$`, rendered as $$y_{t} = x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}$$

To enter a dollar sign in your text, which is something I rarely do, you'll need to escape it: `\$`. The cost is \$30.
