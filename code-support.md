# Code Support

There is support for programming language code inside your pages. For inline code, use single backticks

```
`code goes here`
```

This is what it looks like: `this is computer code`.

For a code block, use three backticks at the start of the line:

````
```
print("This is computer code");
3+2 == 5
```
````

It will be rendered as:

```
print("This is computer code");
3+2 == 5
```
